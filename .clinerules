# Python Coding Conventions for GAIA Benchmark Agent

## Naming Conventions
- Private methods and functions MUST start with underscore (_)
- Internal helper methods that are only called within the same class/module are private
- Public API methods should NOT start with underscore
- Class names use PascalCase
- Functions and methods use snake_case
- Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Function Privacy Rules
These functions should be private (prefixed with _):
- Helper functions used only within the same class
- Internal implementation details not part of public API
- Functions only called by other functions in the same module

These functions should be public (no underscore):
- Entry points (like main())
- Functions called from other modules
- API endpoints
- Functions passed as callbacks to external libraries

## Function Organization
- Helper functions used only internally should be marked private
- Public functions should have comprehensive docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises
- Private functions should have brief docstrings explaining their purpose
- Group related functions together

## Import Organization
- Standard library imports first
- Third-party imports second
- Local application imports last
- Separate groups with blank lines
- Use absolute imports for clarity

## Documentation
- All public functions must have Google-style docstrings
- Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections where applicable
- Private functions should have brief one-line docstrings
- Avoid redundant comments that just repeat what the code does

## Code Structure
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use wrapper classes for extensibility (like MyGAIAAgents)
- Keep functions focused on single responsibility
- Extract complex logic into private helper methods
- Classes should have clear, single responsibilities

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types, not bare except clauses
- Validate inputs at API boundaries using validators module
- Log errors with context information
- Use custom exception classes where appropriate (like ValidationError)

## Testing Philosophy
- Public API should be easily testable
- Private methods don't need direct tests (tested via public API)
- Test behavior, not implementation

## Project-Specific Architecture Rules
- Agent implementations should be in separate files (e.g., langgraphagent.py)
- All agent classes must implement __call__(question, file_name) method
- Configuration should be centralized in config.py
- Use ResultFormatter for all output formatting
- Use QuestionLoader for all question fetching
- Use AgentRunner for agent execution orchestration

## Type Hints
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Import types from typing module
- Use Optional[] for nullable parameters
- Use List[], Dict[], Tuple[] for collections

## Async/Concurrency
- Not currently used in this project
- If added, use async/await consistently
- Document async functions clearly

## File Organization
- One class per file for major components
- Related utility functions can share a module
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible

## Comments
- Use # for single-line comments
- Use """docstrings""" for function/class documentation
- Avoid obvious comments like "# increment counter"
- Explain WHY, not WHAT (code shows what, comments explain why)

## Git Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format
- Include "Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" for AI-assisted code
- Explain both what changed and why

## External Libraries
- scorer.py is copied from official GAIA - do NOT modify function names
- Prefer using existing utilities over creating new ones
- Document external dependencies clearly
